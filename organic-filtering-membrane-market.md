<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Organic Filtering Membrane Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Microfiltration</li><li>Ultrafiltration</li><li>Nanofiltration</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The organic filtering membrane market encompasses three primary types: microfiltration, ultrafiltration, and nanofiltration. Microfiltration uses pore sizes between 0.1 to 10 micrometers, effectively removing larger particles and some bacteria. Ultrafiltration operates with smaller pores, ranging from 1 to 100 nanometers, allowing the separation of smaller viruses and macromolecules. Nanofiltration, with pore sizes between 0.001 to 0.01 micrometers, targets divalent ions and allows monovalent ions to pass through, making it suitable for water softening and specific organic compound separation. Each type plays a crucial role in various applications, including water treatment and food processing.</p></p>
