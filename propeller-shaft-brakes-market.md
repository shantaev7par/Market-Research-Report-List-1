<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Propeller Shaft Brakes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Disk Brakes</li><li>Calliper Brakes</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The propeller shaft brakes market features two primary types: disk brakes and caliper brakes. Disk brakes utilize a rotor attached to the propeller shaft, allowing the brake pads to clamp down on it, creating friction to reduce speed or stop motion. In contrast, caliper brakes consist of a caliper that houses the brake pads and applies pressure to a disc when activated. Both systems are crucial for controlling vehicle dynamics, enhancing safety, and improving overall performance in automotive applications.</p></p>
